									"TRANSACTIONS"

INTRODUCTION:
	it is like all or nothing for example if user1 sends money to user2 if so if money sent and recieved both done successfully means transaction is done,
	if there is an error at any point then transaction is unsuccessfull

SYNTAX:
	START TRANSACTION;
		--SQL STATEMENTS;
			update
			update
	COMMIT;
	OR
	ROLLBACK;

WORKING:
	EXAMPLE OF ALL BOTH QUERY EXECUTED
		START TRANSACTION;

			-- STEP 1: DEDUCTING 1000 FROM ALI
				UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE id = 1;


			-- STEP 2: ADDING 1000 TO ALI
				UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE id = 2;

			SELECT * FROM accounts; (PRINTING FOR TESTING THE QUERY EXECUTES OR NOT)

		COMMIT; (WILL USE COMMIT IF BOTH QUERIES WILL BE EXECUTED PROPERLY , AND IF ANYONE QUERY WILL NOT BE EXECUTED SO WE WILL USE ROLLBACK (AND THE CONDITIONS WILL BE APPLIED THROUGH IF ELSE ON SERVER))

		SELECT * FROM accounts; (ACTUAL UPDATE AS PER TRANSACTION QUERY COMMIT OR ROLLBACK)
