										"PHP"

INTRODUCTION:
	PHP: php => hypertext preprocessor

		php is a server side language which can not be used directly into our PCs so we use a software (XAMPP) 
		and since XAMPP only converts specific location in our system into server then we will have to create folder on that specific locaton.
		so we will have to create all the folders on that location that is called (htdocs)
